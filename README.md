### Kubernetes Node Tools Repository Breakdown:

This repository provides a collection of tools designed to manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes nodes, specifically focusing on:

*   **Kubelet:** These tools can assist in managing and interacting with the Kubelet, the primary node agent in Kubernetes. This could include tools for:
    *   **Configuration management:**  Scripts or utilities to configure Kubelet settings.
    *   **Status monitoring:** Tools to check the health and status of the Kubelet service.
    *   **Log analysis:**  Scripts to collect and analyze Kubelet logs for debugging.
*   **Containerd:**  Tools related to containerd, the container runtime used by Kubelet to manage containers. This might include:
    *   **Container image management:** Tools for pulling, inspecting, or managing container images on nodes.
    *   **Container lifecycle management:** Utilities to interact with containerd for container creation, deletion, and status checks.
    *   **Snapshotter management:** Tools to manage containerd snapshotter for efficient storage.
*   **Sysctl:** Tools for managing and configuring sysctl parameters on Kubernetes nodes. Sysctl allows you to modify kernel parameters at runtime. These tools could help with:
    *   **Parameter modification:** Tools to apply specific sysctl settings to nodes, potentially for performance tuning or Node Specific node hardening required by your organization.
    *   **Configuration persistence:** Mechanisms to ensure sysctl settings are applied consistently across node reboots.
*   **Kernel:** Tools for interacting with or gathering information about the node's kernel. This might include:
    *   **Kernel module management:** Tools for loading, unloading, or checking the status of kernel modules.
    *   **Kernel parameter inspection:**  Utilities to examine kernel parameters beyond sysctl.
*   **Software Installations:** Tools to automate or simplify software installations on Kubernetes nodes. This could involve:
    *   **Package management:** Scripts to install packages using package managers like `apt` or `yum`.
    *   **Binary deployments:** Tools to deploy pre-compiled binaries to nodes.
    *   **Configuration management:**  Scripts to configure installed software.
*   **Troubleshooting Tooling:** A suite of tools to aid in diagnosing and resolving issues on Kubernetes nodes. This is likely to encompass:
    *   **Log collection and analysis:**  Tools to gather logs from various node components and facilitate analysis.

### Foundation Step: Tainting Nodes

Node tainting is a core Kubernetes feature that allows you to prevent pods from being scheduled onto specific nodes. Taints are applied to nodes, and tolerations are defined in pods. For a pod to be scheduled on a tainted node, it must have a matching toleration for that taint.

Tainting nodes is a foundational step when you want to dedicate specific nodes for particular workloads or to prepare a node for maintenance by preventing new workloads from being scheduled there.

### How to Taint Nodes in GKE

In Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you can taint nodes in node pools using `kubectl` or the `gcloud` command-line tool.
Note: it's recommended to taint through gcloud as kubectl isn't permanent. 


**Using `kubectl`:**

1.  **Connect to your GKE cluster:** Ensure your `kubectl` is configured to connect to your GKE cluster.
2.  **Taint a node:** Use the `kubectl taint nodes` command.

    ```bash
    kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
    ```

    *   `<node-name>`:  Replace with the name of the node you want to taint.
    *   `<key>=<value>`:  Define the taint key and value. For example, `dedicated=node-tools`.
    *   `<effect>`:  Specify the taint effect. Common effects include:
        *   `NoSchedule`:  Pods that do not tolerate the taint will not be scheduled on the node. Existing pods are not evicted.
        *   `PreferNoSchedule`:  Kubernetes will try not to schedule pods that do not tolerate the taint on the node, but it's not guaranteed.
        *   `NoExecute`: Pods that do not tolerate the taint will be evicted from the node if they are already running on it, and new pods without tolerations will not be scheduled.

    **Example:** To taint a node named `gke-node-pool-1-xxxx` to dedicate it for node tools with `NoSchedule` effect:

    ```bash
    kubectl taint nodes gke-node-pool-1-xxxx dedicated=node-tools:NoSchedule
    ```

**Using `gcloud` (for Node Pools):**

You can also apply taints to entire node pools during node pool creation or update using `gcloud`.

*   **During node pool creation:**

    ```bash
    gcloud container node-pools create <node-pool-name> \
        --cluster=<cluster-name> \
        --node-taints=<key>=<value>:<effect>
    ```

*   **Updating an existing node pool:**

    ```bash
    gcloud container node-pools update <node-pool-name> \
        --cluster=<cluster-name> \
        --node-taints=<key>=<value>:<effect>
    ```

    **Example:** To taint a node pool named `node-pool-1` with `dedicated=node-tools:NoSchedule`:

    ```bash
    gcloud container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
        --cluster=my-gke-cluster \
        --node-taints=dedicated=node-tools:NoSchedule
    ```

### Example DaemonSet Applying to GKE Nodes with Tolerations

Here's an example of a DaemonSet that could be used to deploy node tools to GKE nodes that have the `dedicated=node-tools:NoSchedule` taint. The DaemonSet includes tolerations to allow scheduling on these tainted nodes:

### DaemonSet yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: node-tools-daemonset
  labels:
    app: node-tools
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-tools
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-tools
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "node-tools"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      containers:
      - name: node-tools-container
        image: ubuntu:latest # Replace with your actual image
        securityContext:
          privileged: true # Required for some node-level operations
        volumeMounts:
        - name: host-root
          mountPath: /host
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - |
          # Example: Run a node monitoring script
          while true; do
            echo "Node monitoring in progress..."
            # Add your node tools and scripts here
            sleep 60
          done
      volumes:
      - name: host-root
        hostPath:
          path: /
          type: Directory
```
